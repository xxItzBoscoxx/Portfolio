              <p>I am... a human? I do things sometimes... okay wait, let me try that again -- </p>
              <br>
              <p>Rhiannon Super is a user experience designer, storyteller, and game developer based in Long Island, New York.</p>
              <br>
              <p>She makes it her mission to go on adventures each day - whether those be in the real world, a video game, movie, book, or in her own imagination.</p>

              <p>Her passion is creating interactive stories for others to enjoy. She wants to captivate people with her narratives and connect with them on an emotional level. She has been successful in doing so through various projects such as Riskmance and Witch’s Aventure, where she contributed to the games’ worldbuilding through ideation and programming using software like GameMaker Studio 2 and Unity.

            <p1>Other stuff I enjoy: </p1>
            <br>
            <p><span>Food:</span> I love trying different foods and desserts. I'm always looking for a new place to add to my list so please, tell me your favorite place to eat! It doesn't matter where in the world this place is because I plan to travel everywhere!!!</p>
            <br>
            <p><span>Games:</span> Sandboxes, adventure games, shooters - I like to bounce around between game types. My favorite series is Kingdom Hearts. I was born around the time of the first game and have played each one ever since. It almost feels like the series aged with me. I love board games and card games too! (Bet you can't beat me in Spite n Malice.)</p>
            <br>
            <p><span>Books:</span> Absolutely love fantasy books!! I have an ever growing To Be Read (tbr) pile on my desk. I wonder if it'll reach the ceiling..? Favorite series to date is Dance of Thieves by Mary E. Pearson. So many emotions while reading this series!!</p>
            <br>
            <p><span>Projects:</span> I don't like having idle hands and I can't remember the last time I wasn't occupied with a project. If you ever see me, I promise I'm doing one of the following: ux/ui research/redesigns, making a new game, practicing web dev (I coded this site, isn't that awesome?), gardening, trophy hunting on Playstation, or learning a new skill. But don't worry, I always have time to dedicate to new projects, so let me know if you want to collaborate!</p>
